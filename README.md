I'm a third year PhD student at the Center of Bioinfomatics (CBI) at Peking University supervised by Dr. Ge Gao. Please see my CV for more information.

My research interest is using deep learning to decipher single cell omics data. Recently I am focused on spatial omics data modeling, including multi-slices integration, spatial-awared embedding.
